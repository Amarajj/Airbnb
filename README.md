# Business Questions Answered - Airbnb Power BI Project
I created an interactive dashboard that answers business questions using real-life data from Nashville, TN.
This project explores Airbnb listing data using Power BI to answer key business questions across three focus areas:

Neighborhood Overview
What property types are most common in each neighborhood?
Which neighborhoods generate the highest estimated revenue?
How does listing availability vary by neighborhood?
Where are instant booking listings most concentrated?


Reviews and Guest Experience
Is there a relationship between number of reviews and rating?
Which property types receive the highest average ratings?
How has review activity changed over time?


Listing Details and Host Activity
How do prices differ across room types?
Who are the most active hosts by listing count?
What are the most common amenities across listings?
